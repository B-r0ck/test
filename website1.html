            <p class="paragraphs">Part of what makes MacBook Air so responsive is that it’s designed entirely around SSD storage. Not only does this make MacBook Air much lighter and more portable than traditional<br> 
                notebooks,it also provides faster access to data. Available in capacities up to 512GB,3 this PCIe-based SSD storage is up to 17x faster than a traditional 5400-rpm notebook hard drive.4 So when you
                flip open MacBook Air, it’s ready to go right away. Even after a month in standby mode, the screen springs to life.
